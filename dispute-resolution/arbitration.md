# Arbitration

## Arbitrators

Arbitrators should be elected at random. Demarchy.

### Staking

Arbitrators are required to stake a certain amount of *ETH*.
If an arbitrators decision is successfully appealed, the amount
of *ETH* staked is slashed, and distributed to _. Stakes are locked
until all disputes appeal periods are expired which an arbitrator was linked to.

Should stakes be case specific or one stake in total?

Should stakes be on a curve? Is the curve ascending or descending. Argumentation is, the curve could be descending as the manipulation potential declines as the amount of arbitrators grows. However decentivication for corruption will the also be reduced.

Slashing should be dependent on reputation, or how many appeals against said judge were successful.

### Reputation

Rank arbitrators the way chess players are ranked, by creating false cases with expected outcomes. We can then see if an arbitrator aligns with the rules of the system and calculate a probability that the arbitrator will enforce the rules of the system.

### Election

## Fake Disputes / Forced Errors

The system should open fake disputes periodically at random
to see how judges will act, this could have certain effect 
on their reputation.

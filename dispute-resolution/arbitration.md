# Arbitration

## Arbitrators

Arbitrators should be elected at random. Demarchy.

### Staking

Arbitrators are required to stake a certain amount of *ETH*.
If an arbitrators decision is successfully appealed, the amount
of *ETH* staked is slashed, and distributed to _. Stakes are locked
until all disputes appeal periods are expired which an arbitrator was linked to.

Should stakes be case specific or one stake in total?

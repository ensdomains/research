# Arbitration

## Arbitrators

Arbitrators should be elected at random. Demarchy.

### Staking

Arbitrators are required to stake a certain amount of *ETH*.
If an arbitrators decision is successfully appealed, the amount
of *ETH* staked is slashed, and distributed to _. Stakes are locked
until all disputes appeal periods are expired which an arbitrator was linked to.

Should stakes be case specific or one stake in total?

Slashing should be dependent on reputation, or how many appeals against said judge were successful.

### Reputation

### Election

## Fake Disputes

The system should open fake disputes periodically at random
to see how judges will act, this could have certain effect 
on their reputation.

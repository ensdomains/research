# Mediation

The mediation phase aims at resolving dispute resolutions while maintaining a mutually beneficial outcome. Mediation is 
financially less expensive therefore incentivizing parties to resolve disputes here.

## Forcing Mediation

A way to force meditation would be to [blacklist](https://github.com/ensdomains/blacklist) domains which are being disputed.
However this will most likely result in bad actors starting disputes on various domains for the chance to block the temporarily,
hence this solution is not good enough.

Forcing mediation becomes especially hard in a decentralized environment where holders of domains have a certain pseudonymity.
Therefore there needs to be enough time before the beginning of a mediation phase to allow the involved parties to be properly
notified of said mediation. The worst case scenario where a party does not react would result in a trial in absentia, which
would obviously lead to immediate arbitration as both parties are required for mediation.

## Potential Outcomes

1. Selling the domain name. (Should be to the price the domain was bought)
2. Paying a royalty (rent) for the usage of a domain name.
3. Agreement to now action.

If none of the above proposed outcomes is met, the mediation will continue to an arbitration phase.
